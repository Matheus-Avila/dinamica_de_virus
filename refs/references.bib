  abstract  = {Author Summary Chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) remains an important health-care problem worldwide despite significant progress in the development of HCV therapy since the discovery of the virus in 1989. Current treatment options are focused on direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) that target specific steps of the HCV life cycle. Danoprevir, one of the DAAs that inhibit the HCV NS3-4A protease, has induced substantial viral load reductions in patients receiving therapy. We study the viral decline during therapy using a multiscale age-structured model that accounts for the dynamics of intracellular viral replication, and which includes the major steps in the HCV life cycle that are targeted by DAAs. We examine the biological parameters contributing to different phases of the viral decline after treatment initiation. We also explore the mechanisms of action of danoprevir and estimate its treatment effectiveness. The multiscale model provides a theoretical framework for studying virus dynamics in hepatitis C patients treated with other DAAs currently in clinical development, and may help one to optimally combine drugs with complementary modes of action to maximize the HCV cure rate.},
